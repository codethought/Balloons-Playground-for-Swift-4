# Balloons-Playground-for-Swift-4

Balloons demo originally found on [Apple's Swift Blogs](https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=9)

This new version has been updated for Swift 4 and XCode 9.2\. It's also been tested for compatibility with Xcode 12.3 and Swift 5.  Also instead of using documentation sections and fragments like the old Playground I converted it to use Markdown. You can view the source comments that create the Markdown blocks by selecting `Editor | Show Raw Markup` from the Xcode menu.
